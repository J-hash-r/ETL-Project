# ETL-Project
Rudimentary ETL Project concerning countries and happiness index. ETL_Extra transformation is an additional transformation performed after the initial transforms as it was found that joining 
on country alone was insufficient. This extra transform generated unique country id to be used as a primary key which enabled country to be a foreign key for further
joining.
